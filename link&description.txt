Description: For this site the main landing page is an 'About Me'page which includes an image of me alongside a description of some of my academic interests and projects. When you are on the 'About Me' page there is a heading at the top which reads "About Me" and a button that links to the second 'More Info' page. When you are on the 'More Info' page there is a heading at the top which reads "More Info" and a button that links back to the 'About Me' page. On the 'About Me' page I customized the margin on the image, the background color for the div with all the information, and the styling of the heading as well as the styling of the button. On the 'More Info' page there is my contact information via buttons that link to my github and my linkedin accounts. Then below I have an unordered list including images and descriptions for some of the projects I have in my portfolio. For the 'More Info' page I customized the heading color, the button stylings, the width of the paragraphs, and the margins on the images.
