        <li><strong>Mass General Safe Sleep: </strong>For this project, I worked closely with the Professional
            Development Manager in the OB Department to create a suite of educational materials aimed at promoting safe
            sleep practices for newborns. The project’s goal was to simplify complex information, making it clear and
            accessible to all parents while addressing misconceptions and reducing sleep-related infant deaths. To
            achieve this, I designed posters, brochures, and crib cards that adhered to Mass General’s style guidelines,
            ensuring consistency and professionalism. The materials are to be displayed in the NICU and Maternity wards,
            providing crucial information to new parents at a critical time. Through this project I learned how to
            distill complex information into easily digestible content.</li>

        <li><strong>NuSci Magazine: </strong>For the print edition of a student-run science magazine, I designed article
            pages and spreads that are visually engaging while ensuring readability. I worked closely with editors and
            writers to ensure that each layout aligned with the magazine’s vision and made complex scientific concepts
            more accessible to a broad audience. By focusing on thoughtful design, I helped maintain a cohesive
            aesthetic throughout the publication. My role in this organization has deepened my skills in creating
            designs that balance creativity with clarity, ensuring the content was both informative and visually
            appealing.</li>

        <li><strong>SkiMate: </strong>SkiMate is a mobile app designed to connect snow sports enthusiasts, fostering
            community and new connections. I contributed to the project by creating a cohesive brand identity,
            conducting user research, and designing intuitive workflows. Key features include a feed of reccommended
            users, a trip planning calendar, location-based recommendations, and a messaging system for users to connect
            before mutual matches. I worked closely with a cross-functional team to asses use cases and create an
            algorithm which would reccommend connections based on age, interests, location, among other preferences.
            Together we prioritized features for the Phase 1 launch while ensuring the app could scale with future
            iterations. The result is a polished Figma prototype which is in the process of being developed into a
            mobile app aimed at building an engaging, inclusive platform for the snow sports community.</li>
